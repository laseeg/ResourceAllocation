    "### General remarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are named as in the paper. However, the indexing of metabolites, fluxes and enzymes is reversed. Due to the iterative construction adding metabolite producing enzymes at the start of the pathway, indexing in here starts at 0 at the final reaction, and increases upstream up until \\ell-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the environmental nutrient concentration is often referred to as nu - so that it's name is independent of the lenght of the pathway considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "If variables are not defined as complex numbers, warnings which state that roots of negative numbers were computed may appear. They commonly occur from numerical trials of iteration starting values with a too large J_{\\ell-1}/J_{\\ell}-ratio. No optimal balanced growth state matching such large ratios exists. However, these complex roots do not affect the performance of the code."
